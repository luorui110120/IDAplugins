The CBuilder users should use the chart plugin provided
in the SDK. You just load the sample into the environment and
compile it. Due to the limitations in CBuilder5, you'll have to
run postbuild.bat after the compilation.
The output files are created in bin/plugins by default.

To create a new module, copy a sample project to a new directory,
rename and edit it.

The settings for the new projects are the following:

        - Predefined preprocessor macros: __NT__,__IDP__
          Define __EA64__ for 64-bit targets
          Define __X64__ for 64-bit debugger servers

        - Include path: ../../include

        - Additional library: ../../libbor.w32/ida.lib

        - Output file name: ../../bin/plugins/filename.plw
          (filename.p64 for 64-bit targets)

        - Post-build batch file should be edited to reflect the
          plugin file name


This setup allows you to create IDA Pro plugins with VCL components.
To create loader and processor modules, please use the command line tools.
The installation procedure for them is explained in the install_make.txt.
